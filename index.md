introduction: |

    With over a decade of experience in web development and project strategy, I focus strong, analytical problem solving skills on user experience and stability. One of my favorite things is that clients tend to come to me with new projects, not looking for bandaids for old ones.

    Mostly, I build **WordPress** and **Jekyll** things on the web -- [this site](https://github.com/jerturowetz/jerturowetz.github.io) among them.

introduction: |

    As a full-stack engineer I've jumped from automating deploys for intranets to budgeting & prototyping web apps. Recently, my main area of focus has been Wordpress development, plugins & extensions.

## What interests me

I possess wide knowledge of technologies used in the current web development stack and enjoy using modern tools including gulp/Grunt, Sass/LESS, Git, Vagrant and Foundation/MUI/Pure though I prefer problem solving, developing web services and/or user interfaces to tooling.

I'm presently looking for a team where I can expand on my PHP skills, grow rigorous at MVC/MVVM/MVWhatever or deep dive in to a new framework (Laravel/Drupal 8). Despite this, I'm a nester who's more into analytical thinking than specific tools so if you think I'd be a good fit for your team, I'm open to Dev-ops, database strategy, JS stack or Python/Django environments; just note these are not my specialty (yet).

I'm very interested by teams who employ structured mentorship relationships in their environments.

## Where to find me

You can join me at one of Montreal's **best** web development [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/members/219597883/) or find me on slack in the [WP Developers Club](https://wpdevelopersclub.slack.com/) & [Make WP Core](https://wordpress.slack.com) channels.

To see what little work I'm allowed to make public, you're welcome to explore the mess which is my [github profile](https://www.github.com/jerturowetz).

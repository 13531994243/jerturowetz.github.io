introduction: |

    As a full-stack engineer I've jumped from automating deploys for intranets to budgeting & prototyping web apps. Recently, my main areas of focus have been custom Wordpress development, plugins & extensions.

## What interests me

I possess wide knowledge of technologies used in the modern web development stack though I specialize in Wordpress & really fast Jekyll things. I like to use state-of-the-art tools including Grunt/Gulp, SASS/LESS, Git, Vagrant, Foundation/Material Design Lite/Pure, AWS, but I prefer problem solving, developing web services and/or user interfaces to tooling.

Though I'm constantly learning on my own I'm presently looking for a team where I can expand on my PHP skills, grow rigorous at MVC/MVVM/MVWhatever patterns or deep dive in to a different PHP framework (Laravel/Drupal 8). I'm very interested by teams who employ structured mentorship/leadership roles in their environments.

Despite this, I'm a nester who's more into problem solving than specific tools so, if you like the cut of my jib and want to pull me towards non PHP technologies, I'm open to AWS specific dev-ops, NoSQL database strategy, any JS stack environment or Python/Django environments; but, please note, these are not my specialty (yet).

## Where to find me

You can join me at one of Montreal's **best** web development [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/members/219597883/) or find me on slack in the [WP Developers Club](https://wpdevelopersclub.slack.com/) & [Make WP Core](https://wordpress.slack.com) channels.

To see what little work I'm allowed to make public, you're welcome to explore the mess which is my [github profile](https://www.github.com/jerturowetz).
